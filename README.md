# Component Library

The Component Library is a versatile collection of reusable React components designed to streamline the development of modern user interfaces. With a focus on simplicity and customization, this library provides ready-made solutions for common UI elements, such as buttons, cards, and navigation bars.

Most of the components are build with React / Typescript and Material Ui.
